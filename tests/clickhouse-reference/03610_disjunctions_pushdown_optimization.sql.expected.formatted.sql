-- Test: Disjunctions pushdown into JOIN branches
-- This test exercises the optimizer controlled by the setting `use_join_disjunctions_push_down`.
-- It checks that disjunctions (OR) over conjunctions can be split and pushed as per-side
-- pre-join filters without changing query results, and that when the optimization is disabled
-- such pre-join filters are not produced. It also validates join-order-dependent pushdown
