-- This test validates that max_execution_speed & timeout_before_checking_execution_speed works with:
--      a) regular query
--      b) temp merge query
-- NOTE: This test uses simple synthetic data to validate the fact throttling was applied.
-- If throttling works as expected - each execution will take >= 1 second, as we allow not more than {max_execution_speed} records/seconds
-- If it doesn't - each select will finish immediately, and the test will fail
-- NOTE: Setting max_block_size=1 to ensure sleepEachRow(..) applies per each row guaranteed and the resulting timing is predictable [2-3] seconds
