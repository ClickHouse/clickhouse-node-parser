    This is the unexpected behavior due to setting max_insert_delayed_streams_for_parallel_write > 1.

    This unexpected behavior was present since version 21.9 or earlier but due to this PR https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/34780
    when max_insert_delayed_streams_for_parallel_write gets disabled by default the issue was mitigated.

    This is what happens:

    - 1st insert works for landing and mv tables
    - 2nd insert gets first block 20220901 deduplicated and second one inserted in landing table
    - 2nd insert is not inserting anything in mv table due to a bug computing blocks to be discarded, now that block is inserted because deduplicate_blocks_in_dependent_materialized_views=0

    Now it is fixed.

    By setting deduplicate_blocks_in_dependent_materialized_views = 1 we can make the code go through a different path getting an expected
    behavior again, even with max_insert_delayed_streams_for_parallel_write > 1.

    This is what happens now:

    - 1st insert works for landing and mv tables
    - 2nd insert gets first block 20220901 deduplicated for landing and both rows are inserted for mv tables
