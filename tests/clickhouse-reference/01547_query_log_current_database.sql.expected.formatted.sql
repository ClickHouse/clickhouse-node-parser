-- This is a cleaner approach for writing a test that relies on system.query_log/query_thread_log.
--
-- It uses current database, and since clickhouse-test will generate random for
-- each run you can run the test multiple times without worrying about
-- overlaps.
--
-- There is still event_date/event_time filter for better performance
-- (even though this is not relevant for runs on CI)
