-- Test for issue #70678: ALTER UPDATE with RENAME unexpected behavior
-- If the ALTER statement is atomic, both UPDATE and RENAME should either
-- succeed together or fail together.
-- The fix rejects UPDATE + RENAME on the same column early to ensure atomicity.
SYSTEM DROP  TABLE IF EXISTS test_alter_atomic;

-- Test 1: Memory engine - UPDATE + RENAME on same column should be rejected
CREATE TABLE test_alter_atomic
(
    c0 Int32
)
ENGINE = Memory;

INSERT INTO test_alter_atomic;

-- Verify the column still has its original name (c0) since the ALTER was rejected
SELECT *
FROM test_alter_atomic;

SELECT name
FROM `system`.`columns`
WHERE database = currentDatabase()
    AND table = 'test_alter_atomic';

-- The INSERT should succeed since atomicity is preserved
INSERT INTO test_alter_atomic;

SELECT *
FROM test_alter_atomic
ORDER BY c0 ASC;

SYSTEM DROP  TABLE test_alter_atomic;

-- Test 2: MergeTree engine - same behavior expected
CREATE TABLE test_alter_atomic
(
    key Int32,
    c0 Int32
)
ENGINE = MergeTree
ORDER BY key;

INSERT INTO test_alter_atomic;

-- Verify column still has original name
SELECT name
FROM `system`.`columns`
WHERE database = currentDatabase()
    AND table = 'test_alter_atomic'
ORDER BY position ASC;

INSERT INTO test_alter_atomic;

SELECT *
FROM test_alter_atomic
ORDER BY key ASC;

-- Test 4: Verify UPDATE + RENAME on DIFFERENT columns works fine
CREATE TABLE test_alter_atomic
(
    key Int32,
    c0 Int32,
    c1 Int32
)
ENGINE = MergeTree
ORDER BY key;

INSERT INTO test_alter_atomic;

-- Wait for mutation to complete
SELECT sleepEachRow(0.1)
FROM numbers(30)
SETTINGS function_sleep_max_microseconds_per_block = 10000000
FORMAT Null;

SELECT
